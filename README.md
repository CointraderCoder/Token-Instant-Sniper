When a new liquidity pool is created on a decentralized exchange (for example, Uniswap), sniper users can profit if they are the first to buy the new token and then sell them to new buyers for a profit, sometimes going up to 50% within 10 minutes of IDOs launch.

This strategy is called "Token Sniping." The key is to be the first to buy the token when the liquidity pool is added to the decentralized exchange.

My sniper bot incorporates a mempool scanner that assures transactions happen effectively, ensuring the "Buy" transaction falls within the same block or one block after the liquidity pool creation transaction occurs.
